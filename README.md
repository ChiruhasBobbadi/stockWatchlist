# stockWatchlist
This is a react-native application where users can search s&amp;p500 stocks, add them to watchlist and see open,high,low,close price, percent increase or decrease along with volumes.

Though this seem pretty simple, it is implemented with best practices and proper architecture.

# Experience & Learning
Had great amount of learning & fun building this application, this is my first react-native app so i went easy on the features of the app, but made sure that its usable.

This app made me realize how important are reactive applications, and will act as a guide for my future projects.
